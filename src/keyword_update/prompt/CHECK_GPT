I’m building a keyword detector to separate answering machines from live callers.
Given a comma-separated keyword list, keep only unambiguous keywords that indicate an answering machine.
Discard any terms commonly used by live callers at the start of a call or named entities since they are not general.
Return only the kept keywords as a comma separated string as fed in the input without additional description.
